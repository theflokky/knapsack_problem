All tests were run using this configuration : 

Processor : - AMD Ryzen 5 4600H
            - 6 cores (2 by sockets so 12) running at 4Ghz
            - architecture x86_64
            - 8 GiB of RAM  running at 3200MHz


For the Ant and GRASP algorithm, we runned the test files 10 times in order to be sure that we can spot the "most" cased solution. Also we used our default value being "30".


First for the 0/1 knapsack problems :

    - On the test file :
        
        - f4_l-d_kp_4_11 :

                - ant_colony :
                        -
