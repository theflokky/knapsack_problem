# Knapsack Problem Project

## Requirements
In order to make the project work properly, you will need to install a few packages, you have a link for each package and the command to install it on Ubuntu :
1. [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) : `sudo apt-get install python3.10`
2. [Pip for Python](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) : Normally included on Python 3.10 Package but if you encounter problem you can click on the link to install it.
3. Tkinter for Python 3.10 [Windows](https://stacklima.com/comment-installer-tkinter-sous-windows/) `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
4. [Matplotlib v3.5.2](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/) : `pip install matplotlib`
5. [SciPy](https://scipy.org/install/) : `pip install scipy`
6. Pil (if on Windows not necessary): `sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk`

## How to use our program ?
### By Graphic Interface
To launch the project, you just need to go into the `knapsack_problem` repertory and enter the following command : `python3.10 launcher.py`.
1. Choosing the type of problem in the first dropdown listing.
2. Choosing the scale on wich you want to work in the second dropdown listing.
3. Choosing the file correponding to the problem on wich you want to work on the third one.
4. Selecting the algorithms with the one you want to work in the correpondant dropdown listing. 
5. Clicking on the Launch button.
6. The results will appears just below this button once the process is finished.
7. If you want to run multiple algorithm on the same file select comp in the algorithm dropdown menu. You will see a checkbox appears. You can now launch the selected algorithm on the file you selected before. You can also change the file in order to make appears a graphic evolution of the running time. 
8. If you want to see a graphic of the evolution of the running time, click on the Show Graph Button.
9. If you want to clear all the results in order to make other tests, click on the Clear Comp button.
10. If you want to generate the curves, do not add/remove algorithm during your tests.

### By terminal
If you encounter problems with the graphical interface you can launch the project by using `python3.10 main.py` and follow the instructions wich we provide you.
